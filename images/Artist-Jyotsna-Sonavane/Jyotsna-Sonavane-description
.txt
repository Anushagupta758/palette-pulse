As an artist, my best work comes from the deepest place inside of me which fulfills the need to create. The painting thus becomes an inward journey for outward expressions. I have always considered painting as a discrete language, not of words but of perception, feelings, and beliefs. My paintings are impressions of the internal aspects of my life. These images of internal struggles of life. In essence, I am finding myself. Living in an artistic family, I was exposed to art conversations every day. However, it is only until a few years ago that I developed the courage to express my thoughts, dreams, memories and aspirations through art. Art has the power to heal and transform. When I discovered just that, I knew I had to dedicate my life to making others feel “something” when in the presence of my art.
